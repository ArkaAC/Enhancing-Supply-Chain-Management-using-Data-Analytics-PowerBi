# Enhancing-Supply-Chain-Management-using-Data-Analytics-PowerBi
# This transformative project aims to improve supply management practices by
# leveraging the synergy of data analytics and Power BI. 
In a rapidly evolving
business environment characterized by complex supply chain dynamics and
increased market uncertainty, the project seeks to address long-term
challenges within traditional supply management methods. Leveraging the
power of data analytics, the goal is to extract valuable insights from disparate
data sets that provide a holistic view of historical trends and real-time factors
affecting the supply chain. Implementing Power BI strengthens the project
and its impact by transforming complex data into visually intuitive and
interactive dashboards.
These dashboards serve as a strategic tool for stakeholders at all levels of the
organization, providing them with timely and useful information to make
informed decisions. Common goals include optimizing inventory levels,
streamlining procurement processes, improving the accuracy of demand
forecasts and improving overall supply chain sustainability. The goal of the
project is to proactively identify potential disruptions using predictive
analytics, enabling agile and strategic adaptation.

# The problem statement of our project is :
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG
manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in
three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. They want to expand to other
metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.
AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not
extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some
of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in
full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer
service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities
and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In
Full’ delivery service level for all the customers daily basis so that they can
respond swiftly to these issues.
We decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which
they will measure ‘On-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, and
OnTime in full (OTIF) %’ of the customer orders daily basis against the
target service level set for each customer.

# The main objective of this project is to create a dashboard to visualize the
# supply chain of AtliQ using PowerBi and provide insights using data
# analytics.
